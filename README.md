# Computer_Vision_Project

This project implements a full deep-learning pipeline for fish species classification using EfficientNet (B0, B1, B2) and ResNet-18. The repository includes custom preprocessing, offline data augmentation, and a clean train/validation/test splitting procedure to ensure proper evaluation without data leakage. The workflow begins with downloading the Kaggle fish dataset into Data/Fish_Dataset, optionally generating an expanded dataset using augmentation.py, and training EfficientNet models on both the original and augmented sets using main.py and main_b0_aug.py. Model checkpoints and metrics are saved automatically, and evaluation is performed through eval_ckpt_main.py, which outputs accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. For a clean baseline, prepare_split.py creates a structured, leakage-free dataset under Data/Fish_Split, which is used by Resnet18.py to train and evaluate a strong ResNet-18 model. The project structure includes architecture utilities, preprocessing scripts, model builders, training pipelines, and evaluation scripts, providing a complete framework for comparing EfficientNet variants against a traditional CNN baseline. The results consistently show that EfficientNet models achieve strong performance (especially with augmentation), while ResNet-18 delivers the highest accuracy under the clean split setup. This repository demonstrates dataset handling, augmentation, model training, and evaluation best practices in PyTorch for image classification research.
